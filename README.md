# Understanding Recursive Functions

A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. This enables a function to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.

## Key Concepts

1. **Base Case**: Every recursive function must have a condition that stops the recursion (base case) to prevent infinite loops.

2. **Recursive Case**: The part where the function calls itself with a modified input, moving closer to the base case.
